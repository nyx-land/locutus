> Resistance is futile. Your metadata will be assimilated. This is a new common
lisp client for Musicbrainz. There's not much here yet, but it has some basic
functionality like searching the MB database.

## Why

The Musicbrainz system that currently exists for CL is old and felt overly
complicated, so I decided to succumb to Not Invented Here syndrome.

There is some preliminary work towards submitting content to MB via webscraping
as well (currently assumes using Bandcamp), because the lack of a submission API
for MB makes adding new content extremely tedious.
